# Pre-work - Tip Me

**Tip Me** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Christian**

Time spent: **9** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [**X**] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [**X**] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [**X**] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

The biggest challenge (which I'm still having a little trouble with) is getting the locale-specific currency to work. There is a lot to learn with iOS development, but with time I should be able to learn this.
